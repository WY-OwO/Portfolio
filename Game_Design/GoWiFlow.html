        <p>For one of my capstone game projects, I joined a team of wonderful artists, writers and programmer to create the game 
            "Go With The Flow". Following the prompt of combining different art styles into one game, we have decided to make a 
            runner game about our main character, Beanie, chasing after his friend, Flow, through three different dimensions. With 
            each dimension, there's a change in the reason why Beanie chases after Flow. Their relationship develops from playful to 
            protecting, to a happy marriage. Or so it was intended to be. Due to time constraint, the game is unpolished.
        </p>
        <p>I have contributed the character concept of Beanie and Flow, dimension 2's character portraits, both dimensions 1 and 2's 
            animation, and dimension 2's monster design.
