        <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Wei-Yan (Jocelyn) Chiang. I am a 22-year-old fourth-year undergraduate of 
            University of California: Santa Cruz, double majoring Arts & Designs: Games and Playable Media, and Business 
            Management Economics. I am a digital artist who is very passionate about character design and am always excited to 
            work from concept to rendered pieces (2D or 3D). I have more than 15 years of art experience, 7 years of digital art 
            experience, 2 years of 2D animation experience and 1 year of 3D modeling experience.
